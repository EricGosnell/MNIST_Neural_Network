# MNIST Neural Network
The purpose of this project is to make improvements on a simple neural network which recognizes numbers based on the [MNIST 784](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&id=554&status=active) handwritten digit dataset.
The original code is based on this [neural network](https://github.com/wvirany/NeuralNetwork) by Walter Virany.

## Goals
- Train the model on the EMNIST letters database.
- Increase accuracy from 85% to greater than 95%.
- Optimize performance to decrease the runtime of each generation.
